hamming
=======

Input: a stream of bits (0 or 1).

Output: the shortest possible Hamming code encoding the bits, padded with 0s at
the end.

Sample input:
110100101

Sample output:
111110100010100

The steps in obtaining the output were
  input        110100101
  pad          11010010100
  parity bits  ##1#101#0010100
  calculate    111110100010100
