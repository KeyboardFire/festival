==========

Input: a positive integer n.

Output: the first n terms of the look-and-say sequence (OEIS A005150), starting
at 1.

Sample input:
10

Sample output:
1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
13112221
1113213211
31131211131221
13211311123113112211

The nth term of the look-and-say sequence is formed by a run-length encoding of
the (n-1)th term. For example, 111221 consists of 3 1s, 2 2s, then 1 1, so it
is encoded as 312211.
