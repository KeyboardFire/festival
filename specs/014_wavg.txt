wavg
====

Input: one or more lines consisting of two space-separated positive integers
each.

Output: a weighted average of the integers, taking the first integer of each
line as the value and the second integer as the weight.

Sample input:
12 7
34 5
56 5
78 2
90 1

Sample output:
39

Note that the output may not always be an integer. Rounding down (truncation)
is acceptable, as is outputting a floating point value (which is ideal).
