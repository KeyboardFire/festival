justify
=======

Input: a single line containing a series of space-separated words, which
consist of one or more printable ASCII characters except space.

Output: the text justified to a width of 80 characters through the following
process:

 1. While the last line is 81 characters or longer, replace the last space
    found in the first 81 characters with a newline.

 2. For each wrapped line except the last, while it is less than 80 characters
    long, replace spaces with two spaces starting from the first space until
    the line reaches 80 characters in length. If it still hasn't reached 80
    characters, repeat, replacing two spaces with three spaces and so on.
