euclid
======

Input: two positive integers, the first strictly greater than the second.

Output: each step of the Euclidean algorithm to find the numbers' greatest
common divisor.

Sample input:
462 180

Sample output:
462 = 180*2 + 102
180 = 102*1 + 78
102 = 78*1 + 24
78 = 24*3 + 6
24 = 6*4 + 0

The output must be given in exactly the sample format.
