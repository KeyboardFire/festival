Input: one or more lines with two space-separated floating point numbers on
each line, representing an x and a y value.

Output: the y-intercept and slope of the corresponding OLS (ordinary least
squares) regression line.

Sample input:
2.34 -1.5
1.337 -3
5 2
0.123 -4.242
4.444 1.5

Sample output:
-4.566474
1.328176

This corresponds to a regression line of Å· = -4.566474 + 1.328176x.

Precision does not necessarily have to be accurate to this degree.
