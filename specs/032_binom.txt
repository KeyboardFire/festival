Input: on three separate lines, two integer coefficients n and m and a positive
integer exponent e, representing the expression (na + mb)^e.

Output: the expanded form of the expression.

Sample input:
2
-3
5

Sample output:
32a^5 - 240a^4b + 720a^3b^2 - 1080a^2b^3 + 810ab^4 - 243b^5

Note that if the coefficient of any expanded term in the output is negative,
the preceding + symbol must become - (i.e. the output "32a^5 + -240a^4b + ..."
is not allowed).
