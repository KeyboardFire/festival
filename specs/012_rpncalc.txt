rpncalc
=======

Input: a series of characters from the set of characters 0-9, +, -, *, /.

Output: The result of evaluating the input as an expression in reverse Polish
notation.

Sample input:
12+3*

Sample output:
9

Note that digits should be interpreted separately (12+ adds 1 and 2), not as
forming a larger number. / is integer division, truncating the result (52/
should result in 2). The input will always form a valid RPN expression and will
never involve a division by 0.
