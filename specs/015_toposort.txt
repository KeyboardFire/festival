========

Input: one or more lines of two space-separated positive integers representing
rules in which the first integer must precede the second.

Output: any valid topological sorting, which orders all elements present in the
input such that all rules are satisfied.

Sample input:

1 3
4 3
3 2
5 6
5 1
4 6

Sample output:
5
1

The input graph will never contain cycles (i.e. it is a DAG). There may be
multiple possible outputs.
