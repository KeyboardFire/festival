## FESTIVAL

This is a personal project of **F**inishing **E**asy **S**imple **T**asks
**I**n **V**arious **A**ssorted **L**anguages.

File organization is as follows:

* `specs` contains the full specifications and other information for all of the
  tasks.

* every other directory corresponds to a programming language and contains the
  solutions to the tasks for that language

    * `c`: C
    * `rb`: Ruby

Here is a chart of the progress I have made:

    # implemented     * in-progress     . unimplemented   @ impossible
       0
       0123456789
    c  #.......
    rb #.......

Here is a list of the tasks with brief summaries of each:

0. `wordcount`: given a series of words, output each unique word once along
   with how many times it occurred.

1. `det`: given a square matrix of integers, output its determinant.

2. `lookandsay`: given an integer, output that many terms of the look-and-say
   sequence.

3. `base`: given an integer and a list of digits, convert the integer to the
   appropriate base using those digits.

4. `textrot`: given a line of text, rotate it repeatedly to create a wrapping
   effects horizontally and vertically.

5. `circle`: given an integer, draw an ASCII art circle with a radius of the
   input.

6. `pathfind`: given a maze with a unique solution, find the length of the path
   through it.

7. `catbuzz`: given a stream of integers, run fizzbuzz on each of them and
   output in parallel.
