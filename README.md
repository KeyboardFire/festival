## FESTIVAL

This is a personal project of **F**inishing **E**asy **S**imple **T**asks
**I**n **V**arious **L**anguages.

File organization is as follows:

* **specs** contains the full specifications and other information for all of
  the tasks.

* every other directory corresponds to a programming language and contains the
  solutions to the tasks for that language

    * `c`: C
    * `rb`: Ruby

Here is a chart of the progress I have made:

    # implemented     * in-progress     . unimplemented   @ impossible
       0
       0123456789
    c  #
    rb #

Here is a list of the tasks with brief summaries of each:

0. `wordcount`&mdash;given a series of words, output each unique word once
   along with how many times it occurred.
